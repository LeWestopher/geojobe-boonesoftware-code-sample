Serve from the web server of your choice.  If you have an up to date version of PHP on your machine, you can easily get up and running by running this command in your terminal in the root directory of this project:
```

This will serve the app on port 4500.

# Introduction

This is a sample application for the B2B introduction between GEO Jobe and Boone Software.  I wrote this app to show the following concepts:

* Knowledge of modern JavaScript, including ES2015
* Usage of easily testable functional programming
* Commitment to coding standards
* Good documentation
* Speed of refactoring and/or development

I hope you enjoy.
